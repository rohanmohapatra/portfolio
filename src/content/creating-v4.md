# Hello v4 â€“ Clean Slate, Same Chaos

**New look. New stack. Same chaotic energy.**

This version is all about simplification, sanity, and some serious Chakra-fueled energy â€” now 43% cleaner, 72% sassier, and 100% more fun to work on (scientifically speaking). If v3 was about flexing the stack, v4 is me whispering to my codebase: "let's just keep it chill this time."

## So, Whatâ€™s New?
#### Chakra UI: Fully Unleashed
When I say v4 of my portfolio is powered by Chakra UI v3, I donâ€™t just mean a version bump. I mean a full glow-up. Chakra UI v3 is more SSR-friendly, smaller in bundle size, and just works better with frameworks like Next.js. In v4 of my portfolio, everything feels tighter, faster, and more... predictable (in the best way).

#### Goodbye Docusaurus (for now...)
Docusaurus 2 was great for blogging, but maintaining it alongside a Next.js app felt like living a double life.
So in v4, Iâ€™ve replaced Docusaurus with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) â€” a lightweight, MDX-powered site generator that just vibes better with Next.js. Now the blog and portfolio finally speak the same language, and everything runs smoother than ever.

**Markdown + Next.js = one happy dev (me)**

#### From Yarn Workspaces to âœ¨ One Clean App
v3 had a monorepo. It sounded cool. It looked pro. It also made me question everything. Constant context-switching. Mini-packages within packages. Build scripts that looked like ancient incantations. v4 ditches all that and goes solo app mode â€” no workspaces, no nonsense. Just one beautiful, cozy, single-source-of-truth frontend.

#### Why v4? Why now?
- Because simpler > smarter.
- Because maintaining multiple frontend tools was draining the fun.
- Because Iâ€™d rather write content than config.
- Because I wanted a portfolio that feels like me â€” clean, fast, focused, and flexible.

#### Migration Madness (Blog Coming Soonâ„¢)
Chakra UI v3 migration? A wild ride. Equal parts refactor and ritual cleansing. How I felt while doing the migration.

A full "How I Survived the Chakra UI v3 Migration" blog post is in the works, featuring:
1. Chakra UI tears (and triumphs) ðŸ˜­
2. Ditching Docusaurus and embracing Nextra like a long-lost twin
3. How simplifying gave me my weekends back

So yeah â€” Chakra UI v3 was the hardest part, and it deserves its own saga. That sagaâ€™s coming soon. Itâ€™s gonna be equal parts rant and resource.ðŸ”¥

## v4 is a vibe.
One app. One flow. One stack to rule them all. Now that the groundworkâ€™s done, itâ€™s time to write, build, and break stuff (intentionally) again.
Catch you in the next post. Probably with memes. Definitely with drama. ðŸ˜Ž
